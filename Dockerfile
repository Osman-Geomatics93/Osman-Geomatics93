# Fixed Dockerfile
# Replace your entire Dockerfile with this:

# Multi-stage build for optimized production image
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files
COPY package*.json ./

# Install ALL dependencies (including dev dependencies for build)
RUN npm ci

# Copy source code
COPY . .

# Build the application
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Production image
FROM node:18-alpine AS runner

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Create non-root user for security
RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 nodejs
RUN adduser --system --uid 1001 nextjs

# Copy built application from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
COPY --from=builder /app/.next/standalone ./
COPY --from=builder /app/.next/static ./.next/static

# Change ownership to nextjs user
RUN chown -R nextjs:nodejs /app

# Switch to non-root user
USER nextjs

# Expose port
EXPOSE 3000

# Set environment variables
ENV NODE_ENV=production
ENV PORT=3000
ENV HOSTNAME="0.0.0.0"

# Start the application
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
